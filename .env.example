# Environment variables for Netlify deployment
# Copy this file to .env for local development

# For static deployment, most environment variables are not needed
# since the app runs entirely in the browser

# If you need to add external API keys in the future:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
# VITE_SOME_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Note: Only variables prefixed with VITE_ will be available in the browser
